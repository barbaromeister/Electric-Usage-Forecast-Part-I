Here is my Python code to show how to use pandas and numpy to clean a dataset and make them ready to analyze and visualise ...

First Step : Clean your Data ---> Remove NaN values
                                  Remove No Named Columns
                                  Make sure that all column names are  meaningfull
                                  Make sure that each value is true value.. (In case of an ParseErrors you should use threshold to catch this values  and normalize them)
